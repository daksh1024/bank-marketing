# Bank Marketing Prediction and Analysis
Data-Driven Approach to Improve Telemarketing in Banking.

## Introduction

Marketing plays a key role in business, banks included. It allows businesses to raise awareness of the products or services they offer, differentiate their products from competitors by educating their customers or potential customers. Most importantly it can allow a business to grow their customer base and earn higher profits.

Our data set which was obtained through direct marketing (telemarketing) of a Portuguese banking institution contains a variety of information on those who participated in the calls. The information gathered ranges from things such as; age, types of loans the person has (home or auto), marital status and education level among many others. There is immense value in being able to predict what demographic is more likely to subscribe to a certain product or service a business may offer. It would allow business to target marketing campaigns more efficiently for certain groups of individuals.

Our group's goal is to build a binary classification model with our data set to gain a better understanding of what type of demographic is more likely to open a term deposit than not. We also want to evaluate how accurate our models are at making these predictions.

## Conclusion

The models that our group would use to determine if a person is more likely to sign up for term deposit is a Logistic Regression model due to its accuracy and its ease to interpret. The table below is sorted based on the magnitude that each independent variable has the dependent variable (whether someone will sign up for a term deposit). The variables that have a greater effect near the top. The variables that are highlighted in red have a negative effect on a persons decision.
